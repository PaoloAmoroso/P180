===========
DISCLAIMER:

This "Console System", for security reasons, is not an exact reproduction of the real operational FLIR System, but an adapted version for a simple use on Flightgear, based on public domain information freely avaiable on internet. Surely is not our intention to disclose any classified information.
This system was developed only for the purpose of increasing, a little, the relism of the simulation, thanks to the author's observations and knowledge of aviation history.

Any reference to a real function, is purely coincidental. The author specifies that this system can be removed from distribution at any time, upon request.

This sistem is, by default, actually limited on a 50 Km range.
